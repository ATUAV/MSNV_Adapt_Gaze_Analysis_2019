An overwhelming majority of chaplains who responded to these questions say that inmates\u2019 requests for religious texts (82%) and for meetings with spiritual leaders of their faith (71%) are usually approved. And about half of chaplains say that requests for a special religious diet (53%) or for permission to have sacred items or religious clothing such as crucifixes, eagle feathers and turbans (51%) also are usually granted.</p>", "marks": {"marks": [{"width": 275, "top": 90, "left": 86, "id": "legend", "height": 54}, {"width": 162, "top": 148, "left": 210, "id": 1, "height": 27}, {"width": 34, "top": 148, "left": 373, "id": 3, "height": 27}, {"width": 141, "top": 188, "left": 210, "id": 5, "height": 27}, {"width": 51, "top": 188, "left": 351, "id": 6, "height": 27}, {"width": 7, "top": 188, "left": 402, "id": 8, "height": 27}, {"width": 105, "top": 229, "left": 210, "id": 9, "height": 27}, {"width": 78, "top": 229, "left": 316, "id": 10, "height": 27}, {"width": 15, "top": 229, "left": 394, "id": 14, "height": 27}, {"width": 100, "top": 269, "left": 211, "id": 15, "height": 27}, {"width": 93, "top": 269, "left": 311, "id": 16, "height": 27}, {"width": 7, "top": 269, "left": 404, "id": 19, "height": 27}, {"width": 54, "top": 310, "left": 211, "id": 20, "height": 26}, {"width": 72, "top": 310, "left": 265, "id": 21, "height": 26}, {"width": 72, "top": 310, "left": 337, "id": 22, "height": 26}]}, "chart": "corpus/reports/pew/ReligionInPrisons/ReligiousAccomodation/chaplains-exec-8.png", "references": {"100": {"tuple_ids": "1,4", "sentence_start_char": 427, "sentence_end_char": 648, "edu_merge": "{100+101}"}, "101": {"tuple_ids": "2,3", "sentence_start_char": 220, "sentence_end_char": 427, "edu_merge": "{100+101}"}}, "sentences": [{"start": 0, "end": 206}, {"start": 207, "end": 427}], "datatable": {"headers": ["_request", "_response", "_percentage"], "data": [{"index": 0, "id": 1, "tuple": ["Religious books or texts", "Usually approved", 82]}, {"index": 1, "id": 2, "tuple": ["Religious books or texts", "Sometimes approved/sometimes denied", 17]}, {"index": 2, "id": 3, "tuple": ["Meetings with leaders from inmates' faith", "Usually approved", 71]}, {"index": 3, "id": 4, "tuple": ["Meetings with leaders from inmates' faith", "Sometimes approved/sometimes denied", 26]}, {"index": 4, "id": 5, "tuple": ["Meetings with leaders from inmates' faith", "Usually denied", 3]}, {"index": 5, "id": 6, "tuple": ["Special religious diet", "Usually approved", 53]}, {"index": 6, "id": 7, "tuple": ["Special religious diet", "Sometimes approved/sometimes denied", 40]}, {"index": 7, "id": 8, "tuple": ["Special religious diet", "Usually denied", 7]}, {"index": 8, "id": 9, "tuple": ["Religious items or clothing", "Usually approved", 51]}, {"index": 9, "id": 10, "tuple": ["Religious items or clothing", "Sometimes approved/sometimes denied", 46]}, {"index": 10, "id": 11, "tuple": ["Religious items or clothing", "Usually denied", 3]}, {"index": 11, "id": 12, "tuple": ["Special hairstyle or grooming", "Usually approved", 28]}, {"index": 12, "id": 13, "tuple": ["Special hairstyle or grooming", "Sometimes approved/sometimes denied", 36]}, {"index": 13, "id": 14, "tuple": ["Special hairstyle or grooming", "Usually denied", 36]}], "text": [{"category": "title", "text": "Requests for Religious Accommodation"}, {"category": "title", "text": "% saying requests from inmates for each of the following are..."}]}}
